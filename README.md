## 🔥 Cloud, Security & Controlled Chaos 👩🏽‍🚒

This space is where I learn out loud. Documenting labs, notes, experiments, and tiny wins that shape my cloud and cybersecurity journey.

I build things, break things, secure them, and sometimes rebuild them with better intention (and better coffee ☕️).

You will find:
☁️ Hands-on cloud & security projects  
📚 Transparent documentation and learning-in-public  
🌸 Progress over perfection
